# Code Demonstrations

* AvaloniaRestDemo - Using an Avalonia based cross platform UI and RestSharp, show how to communicate with a simple ASP.NET WebAPI application. Along the way, show how to overcome the CORS issues that plague the development process.
* InheritedIdentityRole - ASP.NET Identity Framework does not have role inheritance by default. We try to create an IdentityRole that inherits roles from other IdentityRole.
